# Contributing to KanbaSSH

We're delighted that you would like to contribute to KanbaSSH. The first step
is to follow the steps below the Github Flow section. For branch naming, decide 
if you would like to create a `feature`, `fix`, `tests`, or something else, 
and name your branch by prepending one of these. An example might be something
like `feature-color-picker`, or `tests-connection-timeout`. 

Once you have fully fleshed out your idea in code, continue following the steps
below, including running tests to make sure that everything still works.

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, track issues and feature requests, and
accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
[Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We
actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` or `dev`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Unlicense Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [Unlicense License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/) that
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/razzlestorm/kanbassh/issues)
